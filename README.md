# Sand Grains

We participated in the Global Game Jam 2015. This is what we came up with: An old-school point 'n click game with modern vector graphics, played directly in the browser!


No unit tests. No module pattern. Global variables. But it's a playable game done from scratch in 48h.


Made with Adobe Illustrator, Sublime Text, GitHub and Google Drive.
